# zksync-os-sequencer

New sequencer implementation for zksync-os with focus on high throughput, low latency and great DevEx.

## Run

### Local

`cargo run --release` (`release` makes a significant difference for performance)

Rich account `0x7726827caac94a7f9e1b160f7ea819f172f7b6f9d2a97f992c38edeab82d4110` (
`0x36615Cf349d7F6344891B1e7CA7C72883F5dc049`)

To enable local L1 - in other tab (see "L1 State" below for more info)

```
anvil --load-state zkos-l1-state.json --chain-id 9 --port 8545
```

See `node/sequencer/config.rs` for config options and defaults. Use env variables to override, e.g.:

```
batcher_component_enabled=false sequencer_blocks_to_retain_in_memory=256 cargo run --release
```

### Docker

```
sudo docker build -t zksync_os_sequencer .
sudo docker run -d --name sequencer -p 3050:3050 -p 3124:3124 -p 3312:3312 -e batcher_maximum_in_flight_blocks=15  -v /mnt/localssd/db:/db   zksync_os_sequencer
```

### Exposed Ports

* `3050` - L2 JSON RPC
* `3124` - Prover API (e.g. `127.0.0.1/prover-jobs/status`) (only enabled if `prover_api_component_enabled` is set to
  `true`)
* `3312` - Prometheus

### Prerequisites

Only Rust + Cargo.
When running on a new VM:

```
# essentials
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config cmake clang lldb lld libssl-dev apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common git
# rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# add rust to PATH
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"    
```

### Resetting the Chain

Erase the local DB and re-run anvil:

```
rm -rf db/node1/*
anvil --load-state zkos-l1-state.json --chain-id 9 --port 8545
```

## Design

### Subsystems

* **Sequencer** subsystem ‚Äî mandatory for every node. Executes transactions in VM, sends results downstream to other
  components.
    * Handles `Produce` and `Replay` commands in an uniform way (see `model/mod.rs` and `execution/block_executor.rs`)
    * For each block: (1) persists it in WAL (see `block_replay_storage.rs`), (2) pushes to `state` (see `state`
      crate), (3) exposes the block and tx receipts to API (see `repositories/mod.rs`), (4) pushes to async channels for
      downstream subsystems. Waits on backpressure.
* **API** subsystem ‚Äî optional (not configurable atm). Has shared access to `state`. Exposes ethereum-compatible JSON
  RPC
* **Batcher** subsystem ‚Äî optional (configurable via `batcher_component_enabled=true/false`). Has shared access to
  `state`.
    * Turns a stream of blocks into a stream of batches (1 batch = 1 proof = 1 L1 commit); exposes Prover APIs; submits
      batches and proofs to L1.
      Note: currently 1 block == 1 batch, multi-block batches are not implemented yet.
    * For each batch, computes the Prover Input (runs RiscV binary (`app.bin`) and records its input as a stream of
      `Vec<u32>` - see `batcher/mod.rs`)
    * This process requires Merkle Tree with materialized root hashes and proofs at every block boundary (not batch!).
      This will be optimized later on.
    * if `localhost:8545` is available, runs **L1 sender**.

Note on **Persistent Tree** ‚Äî it is only necessary for Batcher Subsystem. Sequencer doesn't need the tree ‚Äî block hashes
don't include root hash. Still, even when batcher subsystem is not enabled, we want to run the tree for potential
failover.

### Component Details

See individual components and state recovery details in the table below. Note that most components have little to no
internal state or persistence ‚Äî this is one of the designing principles.

2. Determine `starting_batch` as the batch following the last committed batch on L1. Determine block numbers for this

   batches from `startin_batch + 1`

### Prover API

```
        .route("/prover-jobs/status", get(status))
        .route("/prover-jobs/FRI/pick", post(pick_fri_job))
        .route("/prover-jobs/FRI/submit", post(submit_fri_proof))
        .route("/prover-jobs/available", get(list_available_proofs))
        .route("/prover-jobs/FRI/:block", get(get_fri_proof))
```

Note that it's the same api as in old sequencer integration, so FRI GPU Provers themselves are fully compatible.

### Principles

* Minimal, async persistence
    * to meet throughput and latency requirements, we avoid synchronous persistence at the critical path. Additionally,
      we aim at storing only the data that is strictly needed - minimizing the potential for state inconsistency
* Few, meaningful data containers / abstractions. Examples:
    * We reuse `BatchOutput` and `BatchContext` structs that are introduced in `zksync-os`  - avoiding further container
      structs
    * We introduce key concept of `ReplayRecord` that has all info to replay a block (along from the key value state
      access):

```rust
pub struct ReplayRecord {
    pub context: BatchContext,
    pub transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
}
```

* State - strong separation between:
    1. Actual state - data needed to execute VM: key-value storage and preimages map - see `state` crate
    2. Receipts repositories - data only needed in API - see `repositories/mod.rs`
    3. Data related to Proofs and L1 - not needed by sequencer / JSON RPC - only introduced downstream from `batcher` -
       see below.

Minimal Node only needs (1).

## Known restrictions

* lacking seal criteria - potential for unprovable blocks
* older blocks are not available for eth_call
* no upgrade/interop logic

## Glossary

* `Block` vs `Batch`:
    * One `block` = one vm run in block_executor = one block_receipt,
    * one `batch` = one FRI proof = one L1 commit.

Important: currently zksync-os uses term `batch` for blocks (e.g. `run_batch` etc.).
Also, return type of a block is `BatchOutput` - which represents a block in our case.
todo: use `use BatchOutput as BlockOutput` in this repo to avoid confusion.

## L1 State

Please see the [How to run with L1 doc](docs/running_with_l1.md)
