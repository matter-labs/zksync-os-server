# ZKsync OS Sequencer

This repo contains the sequencer implementation for ZKsync OS, the OS powering the ZKsync Stack. The ZKsync OS sequencer design optimizes for throughput, low latency, and fantastic DevEx.

## Prerequisites

This project requires:

* The **Foundry nightly toolchain**
* The **Rust toolchain**

### Install Foundry (v1.3.4)

Install [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) v1.3.4 (newer **stable** versions are likely to work too but not guaranteed):

```bash
# Download the Foundry installer
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash

# Install forge, cast, anvil, chisel
# Ensure you are using the 1.3.4 stable release
foundryup -i 1.3.4
```

Verify your installation:

```bash
anvil --version
```

The output should include a `anvil Version: 1.3.4-v1.3.4`.

### Install Rust

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) using `rustup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, ensure Rust is available:

```bash
rustc --version
```

## Run

### Local

To run node locally, first launch `anvil`:

```
anvil --load-state zkos-l1-state.json --port 8545
```

then launch the server:

```
cargo run
```

To restart the chain, erase the local DB and re-run anvil:

```
rm -rf db/*
```

By default, fake (dummy) proofs are used both for FRI and SNARK proofs.

**Rich account:**

```
PRIVATE_KEY = 0x7726827caac94a7f9e1b160f7ea819f172f7b6f9d2a97f992c38edeab82d4110
ACCOUNT_ID = 0x36615Cf349d7F6344891B1e7CA7C72883F5dc049
```

Example transaction to send:

```
cast send -r http://localhost:3050 0x5A67EE02274D9Ec050d412b96fE810Be4D71e7A0 --value 
100 --private-key 0x7726827caac94a7f9e1b160f7ea819f172f7b6f9d2a97f992c38edeab82d4110
```

**Config options**

See `node/sequencer/config.rs` for config options and defaults. Use env variables to override, e.g.:

```
prover_api_fake_provers_enabled=false cargo run --release
```

### External node

Setting the `block_replay_download_address` environment variable puts the node in external node mode, which means it
receives block replays from another node instead of producing its own blocks. The node will get priority transactions
from L1 and check that they match the ones in the replay but it won't change L1 state.

To run the external node locally, you need to set its services' ports so they don't overlap with the main node. See
`run_en.sh` for an example.

### Docker

```
sudo docker build -t zksync_os_sequencer .
sudo docker run -d --name sequencer -p 3050:3050 -p 3124:3124 -p 3312:3312 -e batcher_maximum_in_flight_blocks=15  -v /mnt/localssd/db:/db   zksync_os_sequencer
```

### Exposed Ports

* `3050` - L2 JSON RPC
* `3053` - Block replay server (transport for EN)
* `3124` - Prover API (e.g. `127.0.0.1/prover-jobs/status`) (only enabled if `prover_api_component_enabled` is set to
  `true`)
* `3312` - Prometheus

### Prerequisites

Only Rust + Cargo.
When running on a new VM:

```
# essentials
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config cmake clang lldb lld libssl-dev apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common git
# rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# add rust to PATH
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"    
```

### Otterscan (Local Explorer)

Server supports `ots_` namespace and hence can be used in combination
with [Otterscan](https://github.com/otterscan/otterscan)
block explorer. To run a local instance as a Docker container (bound to `http://localhost:5100`):

```
docker run --rm -p 5100:80 --name otterscan -d --env ERIGON_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3050" otterscan/otterscan
```

See Otterscan's [docs](https://docs.otterscan.io/intro/) for other running options.

## Design

### Subsystems

* **Sequencer** subsystem — mandatory for every node. Executes transactions in VM, sends results downstream to other
  components.
    * Handles `Produce` and `Replay` commands in an uniform way (see `model/mod.rs` and `execution/block_executor.rs`)
    * For each block: (1) persists it in WAL (see `block_replay_storage.rs`), (2) pushes to `state` (see `state`
      crate), (3) exposes the block and tx receipts to API (see `repositories/mod.rs`), (4) pushes to async channels for
      downstream subsystems. Waits on backpressure.
* **API** subsystem — optional (not configurable atm). Has shared access to `state`. Exposes ethereum-compatible JSON
  RPC
* **Batcher** subsystem — only runs for the main node - automatically disabled for ENs.
    * Turns a stream of blocks into a stream of batches (1 batch = 1 proof = 1 L1 commit); exposes Prover APIs; submits
      batches and proofs to L1.
    * For each batch, computes the Prover Input (runs RiscV binary (`app.bin`) and records its input as a stream of
      `Vec<u32>` - see `batcher/mod.rs`)
    * This process requires Merkle Tree with materialized root hashes and proofs at every block boundary.
    * Also runs L1 senders for each of `commit` / `prove` / `execute`

Note on **Persistent Tree** — it is only necessary for Batcher Subsystem. Sequencer doesn't need the tree — block hashes
don't include root hash. Still, even when batcher subsystem is not enabled, we want to run the tree for potential
failover.

### Component Details

See individual components and state recovery details in the table below. Note that most components have little to no
internal state or persistence — this is one of the design principles.

### RPC

* All standard `eth_` methods are supported (except those specific to EIP-2930, EIP-4844 and EIP-7702). Block tags have
  a special meaning:
    * `earliest` - not supported yet (will return genesis or first uncompressed block)
    * `pending` - the latest produced block
    * `latest` - same as `pending` (consider taking consensus into account here)
    * `safe` - the latest block that has been committed to L1
    * `finalized` - not supported yet (will return the latest block that has been executed on L1)
* `zks_` namespace is kept to the minimum right now to avoid legacy from Era. Only following methods are supported:
    * `zks_getBridgehubContract`
* `ots_` namespace is used for Otterscan integration (meant for local development only)

### Prover API

```
        .route("/prover-jobs/status", get(status))
        .route("/prover-jobs/FRI/pick", post(pick_fri_job))
        .route("/prover-jobs/FRI/submit", post(submit_fri_proof))
        .route("/prover-jobs/SNARK/pick", post(pick_snark_job))
        .route("/prover-jobs/SNARK/submit", post(submit_snark_proof))
```

### Principles

* Minimal, async persistence
  * to meet throughput and latency requirements, we avoid synchronous persistence at the critical path. Additionally,
    we aim at storing only the data that is strictly needed - minimizing the potential for state inconsistency
* Easy to replay arbitrary blocks:
  * Sequencer: components are idempotent
  * Batcher: `batcher` component skips all blocks until the first uncommitted batch - thus, downstream components only receive batches that they need need to act upon 
* State - strong separation between:
    1. Actual state - data needed to execute VM: key-value storage and preimages map - see `state` crate
    2. Receipts repositories - data only needed in API - see `repositories/mod.rs`
    3. Data related to Proofs and L1 - not needed by sequencer / JSON RPC - only introduced downstream from `batcher` -
       see below.

## Glossary

* `Block` vs `Batch`:
    * One `block` = one vm run in block_executor = one block_receipt,
    * one `batch` = one FRI proof = one L1 commit.

## L1 State

Please see the [How to run with L1 doc](docs/running_with_l1.md)

## FAQ

**Failed to read L1 state: contract call to `getAllZKChainChainIDs` returned no data ("0x"); the called address might
not be a contract**

Something went wrong with L1 - check that you're really running the anvil with the proper state on the right port.

**Failed to deserialize context**

If you hit this error when starting, check if you don't have some 'old' rocksDB data in db/node1 directory.
